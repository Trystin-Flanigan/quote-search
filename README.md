This project is an adaptaion of one of my past projects from class for the purposes of:
- Learning Angular and its tools
- Improving skills with Javascript / Typescript
- Practicing returning to and refactoring old code

This application seeks to maintain the standards of the original, including:
- Adequate accesibility features (Primarily for screen readers)
- Support for mobile devices and smaller screens
- Full functioning and well presented

This is a simple quote searching application, a user can submit a search and recieve quotes most closely related to what they requested, either by name of the person quoted or the contents. Quotes can also be "Pinned" to keep them from being lost when a new search is made
